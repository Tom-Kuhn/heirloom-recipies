# Ingredients
* 400g/14oz chicken or turkey breast, cut into strips
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp cornflour
* 375g/13oz dried egg noodles
* 2 tsp rapeseed oil
* 6 spring onions, thinly sliced
* 3 tbsp peanut butter
* 2 tbsp sweet chilli sauce
* 1 x 400ml tin reduced-fat coconut milk
* 100g/3½oz sugar snap peas
* 150g/5½oz mixed frozen beans and peas
* 100g/3½oz frozen sweetcorn
* 1 lime, juice only
* 1 carrot, shaved into thin slices using a vegetable peeler
* 75g/2¾oz baby spinach leaves
* 2 tbsp roughly chopped cashew nuts
* 2 tbsp freshly chopped coriander

# Method
1. Put the chicken in a bowl, add the soy sauce and cornflour and mix well. Cover and set aside for a few moments.

2. Meanwhile, bring a large pan of water to the boil, add the noodles and cook according to the packet instructions. Drain in a colander, rinse with cold water until they are cold, then drain once more and tip them back into the cold pan. Add half the rapeseed oil and toss.

3. Heat a wok until hot, add the remaining rapeseed oil and the spring onions and stir-fry for 1 minute, or until softened. Add the peanut butter, chilli sauce and coconut milk and stir until combined. Bring to a simmer, then add the marinated chicken and poach for 4 minutes, or until cooked through. Add the sugar snap peas and simmer for another 2 minutes, or until nearly tender, then add the frozen peas, beans and sweetcorn. Return to the boil, stir in the lime juice and check the seasoning – you might want to add more lime juice or chilli, depending how hot you like it.

4. Stir in the cooked noodles and heat for 1-2 minutes, or until hot through. Stir in the carrot shavings and spinach and remove from the heat. The heat from the dish will wilt the spinach down. Stir a couple of times.

5. Serve in bowls, garnished with the cashews and coriander.

# Tips

Chop everything while the chicken marinates and the noodles cook – this saves time and means that everything is ready before you start actually cooking.

Draining and refreshing (running the noodles in cold water) can be done to noodles, rice and pasta if you’re making a large batch to use later – it stops the cooking process so that you can just heat them through when needed. Adding a little oil stops them sticking together – you can do this with noodles or pasta (not rice) and by using sesame oil, it adds flavour too.

Poaching the chicken in the sauce gives it a nice soft texture, but ensures that it is cooked through – adding a tiny touch of cornflour also thickens the sauce slightly.

This dish can be kept in a sealed container and chilled in a fridge then reheated in a microwave, but it cannot be frozen.
